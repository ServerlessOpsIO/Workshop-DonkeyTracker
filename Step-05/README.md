# Step 5: Adding a Map to the Mobile Device Application

You have a working mobile application leveraging Apache Cordova that tracks the location of your mobile device and sends the data to your AWS backend but what is a location based service without a map? During this workshop we will use Mapbox and you can sign up [here](https://www.mapbox.com) for a developer account with a generous free tier. In this step you will add Mapbox to your mobile application as well as a few options to control the background geolocation plugin.
